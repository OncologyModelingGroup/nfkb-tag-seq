# nfkb-tag-seq
Code for processing and analysis of TAGseq data in "The Effects of IKKβ Inhibition on Early NF-κB Activation and Transcription of Downstream Genes". Modified repository from https://github.com/z0on/tag-based_RNAseq. First clone this repository, and then simply run "bash concatenate_lanes.sh" then "bash matz_commands.sh" with sequence files downloaded from BaseSpace (Illumina Sequencing data tool).
